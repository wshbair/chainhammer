# Choices:

# better keep the same port :8545 everywhere, and instead
# patch the docker-compose.yml files, see ../networks/quorum-configure.sh
RPCaddress='http://localhost:8545'
RPCaddress2='http://localhost:8545'

# use this for unittesting with TestRPCProvider
# RPCaddress, RPCaddress2 = None, None
# or this for experiment runs OR for unittesting with real Ethereum nodes:
# RPCaddress, RPCaddress2 = 'http://localhost:22000', 'http://localhost:22001' # use two different Quorum nodes for writing and reading
# RPCaddress, RPCaddress2 = 'http://localhost:22001', 'http://localhost:22002' # crux dockerized, see https://github.com/blk-io/crux/blob/master/README.md#4-node-quorum-network-with-crux
# RPCaddress, RPCaddress2 = 'http://localhost:8545', 'http://localhost:8545'  # orbita-center_parity-poa-playground; parity-deploy
# RPCaddress, RPCaddress2 = 'http://localhost:8545', 'http://localhost:8546'  # javahippie_geth-dev; use two different nodes for writing and reading


# how many tx to send in send.py
# not anymore here, is a CLI argument now, for ./send.py
# NUMBER_OF_TRANSACTIONS = 5000


# obsolete now
# initially the contract was deployed manually with ./runscript.sh private-contract.js
# And wait-for-something-to-happen was triggered by chain moving or not
# (which only works for raft & instantseal).
# Now obsolete because we can simply always deploy our own contract first,
# see deploy.py
# OLD:
# if consensus algorithm is Quorum raft, then --> True
# could be automated now ... from clienttype import clientType
# TODO: replace this constant by  clienttype CONSENSUS query
# RAFT=False
# RAFT=True


# Quorum can take a minute until the chain finally starts moving,
# then the default timeout=120 might be too short. Give more time:
TIMEOUT_DEPLOY = 300

## submit transaction via web3 or directly via RPC
ROUTE = "RPC"  # "web3" "RPC"

# parity's idiosyncracy:
# 'Time-unlocking is only supported in --geth compatibility mode.'
# see https://github.com/drandreaskrueger/chainhammer/blob/master/parity.md#run-14 for why and how
# so either --geth or unlockAccount() for each transaction, then make this True:
PARITY_UNLOCK_EACH_TRANSACTION=False

# to avoid the parity --geth switch, one could unlock parity already when starting, e.g.
# parity --unlock 0x39c6ad93dfb708143322d8bbf4c35734f6480249 --password /home/parity/password
# e.g. by manually editing the docker-compose.yml file after ./parity-deploy.sh --config aura --nodes 3
#  services: --> host1: --> command: --> add this: (address is in deployment/1/address.txt)
#    --unlock 0x39c6ad93dfb708143322d8bbf4c35734f6480249 --password /home/parity/password
PARITY_ALREADY_UNLOCKED=False


# sorry, but time saving RPC optimisation makes no sense then anyways:

    print ("Sorry, this parameter combination is not implemented:")
    print ('PARITY_UNLOCK_EACH_TRANSACTION and ROUTE=="RPC"')
